# Testing a UIPickerView view with XCUIApplication tests

The demo repository is an attempt to test a UIPickerView in UI Tests with XCTest UI testing APIs.


It is possible to swipe the whole picker view up in tests. What I have not figured out is how to select a **specific** picker view item in the tests.

The question is posted here:
